        Ever since I was 10 or 11, I’ve dreamed about living in an RV. The idea
        of having all my equipment with me, ready to go anywhere I wanted at a
        moment’s notice, seemed too good to be true. Of course, at the time, it
        mostly <em>was</em> too good to be true. Solar panels were extremely
        expensive, batteries stored very little energy, and high-speed wireless
        internet access was practically still the stuff of science fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the next decade and a half, that all changed. The proliferation of
        smart devices meant huge leaps in both cellular networking speed and
        lithium battery availability. Solar power became much more affordable.
        YouTube tutorials became ubiquitous, and suddenly anyone could find
        dozens of guides demonstrating how to take advantage of all these
        technologies.

        By the time 2017 rolled around, I was fortunate enough to have a
        fully-remote job in software engineering. At that point, my wife and I
        had tossed around the idea of living in an RV for a couple years, and we
        finally decided this was the right time to give it a shot.
      </p>
      <p>
        After lots of online research and visiting an RV show for some hands-on,
        we were firmly settled on getting something based on the Mercedes
        Sprinter chassis (aka a FedEx van). We found a good deal on a used 2006
        Sprinter conversion (Leisure Travel FS210B) that had been a rental for
        the last decade, bought it, and immediately headed up to Portland with
        our two dogs in tow.
      </p>
      <p>On our way back home from that inaugural trip, the engine exploded.</p>

      <h2>Space</h2>
      <p>
        Despite what you may have seen on Instagram, #vanlife isn’t all glamour.
        At the end of the day, you are literally living in a van. The extended
        wheelbase Sprinter is just shy of 22 feet long.<sup class="footnote-ref"
          ><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup
        >
        This is great, because it can fit comfortably in most parking spaces.
        Spaces in the United States tend to be around 20 feet deep, and the
        extended wheelbase lets you back in several feet over the edge of
        parking lots or other unusable areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        The size is great for parking, but also makes for a truly tiny home.
        Inside, the Sprinter is 91 square feet.<sup class="footnote-ref"
          ><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup
        >
        Actual floorspace (including fixed seating areas and bed) is just over
        60 square feet.<sup class="footnote-ref"
          ><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup
        >
        It took many years and many moves to get to this point. Outside the van,
        we also rent a 25 square foot<sup class="footnote-ref"
          ><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup
        >
        storage unit, and I’ve stored a few things like vinyl records and
        instruments at my parents’ house. Even with all the reduction in
        “stuff”, we’ve still had to squeeze every inch of space out of the van.

          on the folding desk I added in front.
        </figcaption>
      </responsive-figure>
      <p>
        Leisure Travel’s conversion originally had an electric sofa in back that
        folded down to become the top part of the bed. We kept that system for
        around a year after moving into the van full-time, but eventually
        removed the sofa and replaced it with a permanent mattress running
        sideways in the van. This has worked pretty well for us, but would
        probably be quite uncomfortable for anyone over ~5’6”.<sup
          class="footnote-ref"
          ><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Changing the bed layout gave us a permanent and more comfortable
        sleeping surface, easier access to the back of the van, and more
        under-bed storage space. Some of the freed up space toward the front of
        the van was repurposed into a cabinet, which provides a work surface,
        permanent dog bed, and additional storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        In front, I added a folding desk to take advantage of the passenger
        captain’s chair. The desk was originally designed to sit on the rubber
        stopper for the passenger sliding door, but I later modified it to allow
        hanging from some hooks above the door. This allows the door to be
        freely opened and closed while the desk is in use.
      </p>

      <hr />
      <h2>Electricity</h2>
      <p>
        One of my main goals during planning was to reduce resource usage as
        much as possible. The fewer resources needed to keep running the van,
        the more flexibility we’d have when deciding where to stay, and for how
        long. Of course, we didn’t have much control over water storage since
        the van had already been converted, but electricity was entirely up to
        me.

      <h3>Solar &amp; Battery Bank</h3>
      <p>
        You can only fit so many watts of solar panels on the roof of a
        Sprinter. I was able to fit four 170-watt panels, for a total
        theoretical 680 watts maximum.<sup class="footnote-ref"
          ><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup
        >
        That’s not a lot of daily generation to deal with,<sup
          class="footnote-ref"
          ><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup
        >
        so reducing electricity usage wherever possible was critical if we
        wanted to avoid having to frequently plug in for charging.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, solar panels are only half of the story for off-grid setups.
        Just as important is where you store energy generated by those panels
        for use during dark nights and cloudy days. Our power storage is four 12
        volt, 100 amp hour LiFePO4 batteries,<sup class="footnote-ref"
          ><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup
        >
        for a total of 400 amp hours. There is all sorts of advice around how to
        optimally charge and discharge lithium batteries, but I’ve gone with 70%
        usable for my calculations. This gives 280 usable amp hours per charge,
        or ~3.4 kilowatt hours.
      </p>
      <h3>Lighting</h3>
      <p>
        When calculating electricity use, it’s really amazing how quickly small
        inefficiencies add up. The original conversion included six halogen
        <a
          href="https://www.hannarv.com/P/6499/ManufacturersSelectNIDPrizmSurfaceMountSwitchedOverheadLightBrushedNickel"
          >can light fixtures</a
        >
        underneath the cabinets.<sup class="footnote-ref"
          ><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup
        >
        Each halogen bulb used 10 watts, which means running those lights for
        six hours in the evening would use 360 watt hours, or over 10% of our
        battery bank’s usable capacity!
      </p>

          upgrade.
        </figcaption>
      </responsive-figure>
      <p>
        The overhead lights were similarly wasteful. Each of the three
        fluorescent fixtures used ~27 watts, nearly three times more than each
        of the halogen bulbs. I replaced the overhead lights with LED bulbs,
        which dropped their energy usage about 50%, to 14 watts each.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve loved controlling lights remotely for about as long as I can
        remember. My childhood bedrooms often had strings taped to
        lightswitches, draped around makeshift furniture-pulleys so I could turn
        them on or off from bed. As I got older, this transitioned to an
        interest in home automation, and I jumped on the Phillips Hue bandwagon
        pretty early on. Customizing light colors and controlling them with my
        phone was definitely something I wanted to maintain in the van.
      </p>
      <p>
        To scratch that itch, I decided to replace the under-cabinet lights with
        HomeKit-compatible LED ones. Adafruit’s 12-LED
        <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2852">RGBW NeoPixel Ring</a>
        happened to be fit perfectly inside the existing fixtures, so I just
        removed the old bulbs. To tie everything together, I used a Raspberry Pi
        runing <a href="https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS">HAP-NodeJS</a> to
        integrate with HomeKit, and a simple Python script to actually
        communicate with the lights.<sup class="footnote-ref"
          ><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup
        >
        The new lights have full color and brightness control, and only use
        about one watt each when on full brightness (usually a lot less, our
        standard evening setup averages around 2-3 watts), so it’s a huge energy
        savings with lots of additional functionality.

      <h3>Energy Conservation</h3>
      <p>
        To avoid DC -&gt; AC conversion losses (something like ~10%), we run as
        much as possible directly off 12 volt power. To help with this, I’ve
        added five 12 volt “cigarette lighter” accessory sockets, for a total of
        six running off the “house” battery bank. Five are in the back of the
        van, and one is in the cab. USB-C, and especially USB-C PD, have been a
        huge help in keeping things DC. All of our electronics other than
        Charlene’s laptop can be charged with either USB-A (“normal” USB),
        USB-C, or proprietary 12 volt adapters.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only things that permanently run off AC power are our refrigerator,
        my wife’s laptop charger, our TV, and an Apple TV.<sup
          class="footnote-ref"
          ><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup
        >
        Those are all hooked to a
        <a
          href="https://www.victronenergy.com/inverters/phoenix-inverter-vedirect-250va-800va"
          >Victron Phoenix 12/500</a
        >, which runs 24/7. The AC electrical panel is powered by a
        <a
          href="https://www.victronenergy.com/inverters-chargers/multiplus-12v-24v-48v-800va-3kva"
          >Victron MultiPlus 12/3000/120</a
        >, which is primarily used for shore power passthrough and battery
        charging. When we’re on the road, we only turn it on to run higher-power
        devices like hair dryers. Running the larger inverter constantly would
        raise our energy usage due to its higher zero-load wattage.<sup
          class="footnote-ref"

      <p>
        I highly recommend all of Victron’s equipment. In addition to the two
        inverters, we also use their
        <a

        ><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup>
        battery monitor. All of their products have been very reliable,
        well-documented, and even frequently updated (both device firmware and
        iOS app). When on the road, being able to see historical yield
        information has been very useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        By far the largest electricity consumer in the van is the refrigerator.
        I installed a
        <a
          href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/frigidaire-4-5-cu-ft-freestanding-mini-fridge-freezer-compartment-silver-mist/50160171"
          >Frigidaire residential mini-fridge</a
        >, which has an estimated yearly electricity use of 265kWh.<sup
          class="footnote-ref"
          ><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup
        >
        I ran a few short tests with a
        <a href="http://www.p3international.com/products/p4400.html"
          >Kill A Watt</a
        >
        after installation, and that estimate seems fairly accurate, or possibly
        a bit on the high side.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from a couple periods of multi-week heavy clouds, we’ve been able
        to comfortably maintain a charge just from solar power from around
        spring through fall in the United States. This only applies when the van
        is in fully or mostly-open areas. Shady spots are great for keeping the
        temperature down, but wreck solar yields. As of this writing, we’ve been
        staying at a very shady spot in Portland for the last several months,
        and only yield ~250-350Wh on sunny days. Sunny days in open spots give
        much higher yields of &gt;1.5-2kWh.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Internet Connectivity</h2>
      <p>
        Since I’m a full time remote software engineer, consistent internet
        access is critical for me. Our primary internet access since moving into
        the van has been through the Verizon network. This has worked incredibly
        well, and we’ve had reliable service in the vast majority of spots
        across the country.
      </p>

      <p>
        Originally, we had this service through a company called
        <a href="https://unlimitedville.com">Unlimitedville</a>. They provide
        unlimited access to the major US networks with no throttling, and we
        consistently used hundreds of gigabytes of data each month without any
        issues for around a year. The only downside is that their service is
        quite expensive; we paid $250/month. In late 2018, we switched to a
        Verizon unlimited prepaid plan that also offered unlimited data, but for
        $65/month. Unfortunately, this plan was grandfathered in 2019, and is no
        longer available to sign up for.
      </p>
      <p>
        When traveling in Canada, we tethered to my phone. We have Cricket
        service, which allows for normal use of your plan in Canada and Mexico.
        My current plan has 10 gigabytes of tethered transfer,<sup
          class="footnote-ref"
          ><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup
        >
        which is enough to get work done for a good while.
      </p>
      <p>
        We started out using the
        <a
          href="https://www.verizonwireless.com/internet-devices/verizon-jetpack-4g-lte-mobile-hotspot-ac791l/"
          >Netgear AC791L</a

        and

          >MiFi 8800L</a

        modem/routers for internet access.<sup class="footnote-ref"
          ><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup
        >
        For the most part they worked okay, but both were extremely prone to
        overheating. It seems like they definitely aren’t designed for extended
        use, or even to remain plugged in for an extended period. Eventually I
        decided they were too big a potential fire hazard to keep using
        constantly, and replaced them with a
        <a
          href="http://mofinetwork.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=189"
          >MoFi 4500</a
        >. It’s much more configurable, has ethernet ports,<sup
          class="footnote-ref"
          ><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup
        >
        and hasn’t had any overheating issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re looking into options for cell data plans, or equipment like
        modems or boosters, I recommend checking out the
        <a href="https://www.rvmobileinternet.com/overview/#cellular"
          >Mobile Internet Resource Center</a
        >. They’ve got lots of great articles and reviews, and really keep on
        top of the industry. They also make an iOS and Android app called
        <a href="http://www.twostepsbeyond.com/apps/coverage/">Coverage?</a>
        that I used many times throughout the trip. It was surprisingly accurate
        for the most part.

        There have been tons of miscellaneous projects, challenges, and learning
        experiences in improving and living in the Sprinter. I'll go over a few
        of them here, but there are lots that didn't make the cut. Just because
        it's on wheels doesn't mean you're free from basic "homeownery" tasks
        and maintenance, either (hello re-caulking a bathroom).
      </p>
      <p>
        The fridge has worked quite well for the most part, and seems to be
        holding up well after 18 months. Its temperature isn’t always as
        consistent as would be ideal. To keep it cool enough, it has to be set
        so low that we sometimes end up with frozen items in the refrigerator
        compartment. This fridge was designed for residential use, but has a
        built-in childproofing lock. I modified the lock to have a permanent

        before driving.

        Water storage in the van is quite limited. It has a 26 gallon fresh
        water, 21 gallon gray water, and 10 gallon black water tank. While
        traveling, we consistently needed to fill up on fresh water and dump
        gray about every three days. The black tank generally needed to be
        dumped around once per week. Going into owning the van, I wasn’t sure
        how I would feel about the dumping process, but it’s really not bad to
        deal with.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we got the van, the Dometic kitchen faucet was damaged, and would
        often spray water out of the side. The entire fixture is cheap plastic
        that according to other reviewers is very prone to breaking.
        Unfortunately, as with many parts made for RVs, it’s still wildly
        overpriced at around
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P03K8W2">$125</a>. In addition,
        due to the way the faucet head is oriented, it pointed directly out of
        the sink basin in the “open” position. We just lived with these
        frustrations for quite a while, but I eventually realized that the
        existing head just had standard 1/2” threads, and built a simple PVC
        replacement that has solved all of our issues with the original fixture
        head.

        Keeping cool was a major challenge during our travels. Since we were
        often off-grid, we were rarely able to run the air conditioning unit
        that came with the van. We kept it for a while and used it only when
        plugged in, but then in winter 2018 removed it and replaced with a
        <a href="https://www.airxcel.com/maxxair/products/fans/maxxfan-deluxe"
          >Maxxair MaxFan 5100K</a
        >. This has worked out great so far, even during a few 95º F<sup

          ><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup
        >
        days - admittedly parked in the shade. We don’t plan to take the van on
        trips during intense heat again, as even with the AC it could get pretty
        miserable.

        The other side of climate control is insulation. We purchased a roll of
        Reflectix early on, and cut it to make covers for the front windows. To
        mount the window covers, we sliced slots into the edge of the Reflectix,
        inserted neodymium disc magnets, and sewed them in place with standard
        black edging. These have held up and worked very well, and cost very
        little to make.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Reflectix panels take care of both insulation and privacy for the
        front windows. The back windows are all tinted, providing daytime
        privacy. For nighttime, we got roller shades from
        <a href="https://mcdinnovations.com/">MCD</a>. They’re made of a
        high-quality material that completely blocks any light from getting
        through, but need frequent adjustment to avoid becoming stuck or very
        slow.

      <h2>Back to That Engine</h2>
      <p>
        On the way home from our first trip after buying the van, the engine
        threw a rod. It was the 4th of July, but after a couple hours (and two
        tow trucks), we were able to get towed into Red Bluff, the nearest town.
        Of course, everything was closed, but we were dropped off outside a
        local mechanic where we could spend the night.<sup class="footnote-ref"
          ><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup
        >
        Thankfully, everything worked out in the end, and we were able to get
        the engine replaced to get the van back on the road (after quite a few
        weeks, we got a rental car to get home in the meantime).
      </p>
      <p>
        After lots of cleanup and prep work,<sup class="footnote-ref"
          ><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup
        >
        we moved into the van full-time in late 2017. After traveling the United
        States and Canada, we spent some time in California before finally
        taking the van back to Portland in early 2019.<sup class="footnote-ref"

        We’ve been at an RV park here since, and are planning to stay until we
        get a house in the area sometime during 2020. I’ve always wanted to try
        living in a van, but am still a bit surprised it’s worked as well as it
        has for this long.

        So, what did I learn from this admittedly somewhat ridiculous venture?
        First of all, I really like the much smaller than average space. No
        matter what size my living space is going forward, I want to apply the
        same drastic minimalism to my thinking as <em>has</em> to be applied to
        live in the van. That being said, I’m very much looking forward to a a
        normal desk/workspace, and a full-size shower.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I’ve already talked about in detail above, I really like being more
        conscious of my resource usage. I think a lot more about my water and
        electricity use, and garbage production than ever before. When your use
        of a resource has such a direct impact on your daily life, it really
        helps to put the importance of conservation into perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even with all the rough patches and frustrations, I’m still very happy
        to have tried this. I learned tons about several different disciplines,
        saw huge chunks of North America that I’d never even been near before,
        and now kid me finally knows what it’s like to live in a van.

              This project came together surprisingly fast and smoothly!
              Unfortunately, electrical noise from the fridge compressor turning
              on and off kept interfering with the data line of the fixtures
              that ran behind it, causing them to randomly turn on. This was a
              minor frustration during the day, but could be quite annoying at
              night. I tried several solutions with varying degrees of success.
              Coax grounded at both ends of the run was by far the best thing I
              tried, but once in a while, the fridge shutting off would still
              very dimly trigger one of the fixtures. I eventually just rerouted
              the cables to run the other direction, avoiding the fridge
              entirely, and haven’t had any issues with interference since.
