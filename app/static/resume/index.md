Hi, I'm Paul Straw. Ever since I was a kid, I've loved making things and solving problems with computers. These days, I channel that obsession into creating products using tools like JavaScript, Ruby, Elixir, C#, PostgreSQL, and of course a healthy dose of HTML and CSS.

When I have the opportunity, I enjoy making video games, electronics, open source software, and teaching other people about computers. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/paulstraw), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/notpaulstraw), [my website](https://paulstraw.com), or [email](mailto:paulstraw@paulstraw.com).
