I'm happy to announce that my first Mac App Store app has been approved and released to the public! It's a simple menu bar app that shows you the current status and viewer count of a Twitch stream. I created it over the course of a couple days using [RubyMotion](http://rubymotion.com), and far too much time tweaking the icon.

If you're a Mac user streaming with Twitch, you should check it out: [ViewMaster for Twitch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/viewmaster-for-twitch/id913092374).
