I'm a big fan of flat, accurate headphones. In my opinion, Beyerdynamic's DT 770 are some of the best in the world. They provide excellent sound isolation, and a faithful reproduction of every music genre.

I've had my 770s for something like seven years. They are durable and comfortable, but their reliance on a wired connection now makes them difficult to use in many cases. You might assume that the iPhone 7's lack of a headphone jack was behind this, but it was mostly prompted by trying to work on a laptop on the couch.

Finally, I decided it was time to pull the plug and upgrade my DT 770s to a wireless Bluetooth connection. I've been using them wireless for a couple weeks now, and it's an incredible upgrade to an already great set of cans. I thought I'd post a couple photos of my process and the parts I used, in order to help other people who want to do a similar conversion.

For the Bluetooth connection, I went with the [Grifin iTrip Clip](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HRYAP1K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=paulstraw-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01HRYAP1K&linkId=dc8f193941cd4da59541db7fada55fce) adapter. So far, I’ve been very happy with it. It provides good sound quality, convenient controls, and can easily clip onto the head strap padding. It also connects to two devices at once, so I can easily switch between my laptop and iPhone.

After searching around for a while, I decided to use this [Philmore](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LXOIVKI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=paulstraw-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00LXOIVKI&linkId=ac9c9617f43b94ce7f9fcaea4922c421) panel mount headphone jack to provide the external connection. It fits well in the small space available in the DT 770 ear cups.  Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with a pinout, so I used a [left/right test video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTvJoYnpeRQ) to sort out which was which. If you decide to use the same part, here’s a photo that shows the pinout, along with standard headphone wire colors:

The DT 770 wires are coated in an insulating material. I burned this off the ends of each wire using a lighter so I could solder them to the jack terminals.

Once the headphone was disassembled ([disassembly video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBEew8Sa-i8)), I drilled a 3/8” hole where the original cable came out, and the jack popped right into place.

After soldering the wires in place and putting everything back together, I had spent about 15 minutes in work and $30 in parts. A pretty good deal for an upgrade that lets me walk around the whole house using my favorite headphones!
